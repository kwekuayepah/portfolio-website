# 2025: A Year of Alignment

This year might be one of my best so far, not because everything went according to plan, but because it didn’t.

I entered 2025 energized, full of ideas, and determined to make it better than 2024. The previous year took a lot out of me personally, and I felt its effects across different areas of my life. So this year wasn’t about doing more, it was about doing things differently.

## Stepping Back to Move Forward

After five years and eight months of nonstop work at a reputable fintech company in Ghana, I made a deliberate decision to pause and reassess my journey. Over the years, I had grown from a junior software engineer into an engineering manager, helping architect and manage core payments and messaging platforms. The experience shaped how I think, not just about engineering, but about product value and impact.

On paper, life was good. But internally, I wanted more challenge, more learning, and a clearer sense of direction.

Then something unexpected happened.

A recruiter reached out, saying my name had come up repeatedly in conversations across the industry. I didn’t even know who had recommended me. That moment alone felt like quiet validation, proof that the work I had done over the years mattered beyond the walls I was used to.

The interview process wasn’t easy, but it was fair. And when the offer came, it was good, very good. (I love money, but let’s be honest: only life-changing money is truly jaw-dropping.)

## Finding My Place Again

Joining the new company came with the usual adjustment period. New culture. New people. A tech stack I hadn’t worked with much, JavaScript, which I’ve never been particularly fond of. But I adapted.

About three months in, during one of our company-wide one-on-one sessions, I spoke with a product and strategy lead. She was intrigued by my background, and shortly after, my name surfaced again, this time internally. I was asked to move into the platform team because of my experience working across complex systems.

I was surprised. And excited.

Platform work is where things get intense, and I’ve loved every bit of it. In a short time, I’ve been able to contribute meaningfully, to the point where people forget I’m still relatively new. That’s amusing to me, because I know I’m only just getting started.

## Choosing Consistency Over Motivation

Outside of work, I made a quiet but important commitment: to take the gym seriously.

I’d tried before. Many times. And failed just as often. A close friend once told me I wasn’t truly committed, and he was right. This year was different.

For the past nine months, I’ve been consistent. Not perfect, just consistent. I’ve gone from 92kg to 84kg, and more importantly, I’ve built a habit. It’s no longer something I force myself to do; it’s simply part of my life now.

## Creating, Learning, and Trusting the Process

Leaving my previous role also gave me something I hadn’t had in a long time: time.

I filled it, mostly behind my laptop, unsurprisingly, working on personal side projects. Some of them are close to launch, and I’m genuinely proud of what I’m building.

I’ve also finally embraced AI. After months of skepticism and personal research, I’m fully on the wave now. It’s fascinating how quickly ideas can turn into products. I’m currently reading *The Origin of AI* by Dwarkesh Patel, and it’s been stretching how I think about productivity, creativity, and trust in systems.

I’m not at peak productivity yet, but I’m learning, observing, and staying intentionally critical. I don’t fully trust AI, and that’s okay.

## Looking Ahead

I’m excited for what’s next, not in a loud, dramatic way, but with quiet confidence.

Let’s see how it goes.
